Great question! The choice to implement MyLRUCache and MyBinarySearch as templates while keeping the others as concrete classes was based on several design considerations:

Template Classes (MyLRUCache & MyBinarySearch)
MyLRUCache
Why template?

Type Flexibility: An LRU cache is inherently generic - users need to store different key-value pairs (int→string, string→object, etc.)
Performance: Templates avoid runtime overhead of type erasure or void* casting
Type Safety: Compile-time type checking prevents mixing incompatible key-value types
STL Compatibility: Follows the pattern of STL containers like std::map<K,V>, std::unordered_map<K,V>
MyBinarySearch
Why template?

Algorithm Genericity: Binary search works on any comparable type (int, double, string, custom objects)
STL Integration: Works seamlessly with std::vector<T>, std::array<T>, etc.
Zero-Cost Abstraction: No runtime overhead compared to type-specific implementations
Reusability: Single implementation handles all sortable types
Non-Template Classes (MyMemcpy, MyBitSort, MyMalloc)
MyMemcpy
Why not template?

Low-Level Operation: Works at the byte level regardless of data type
Void Pointer Interface: Takes void* parameters like standard memcpy
Performance Focus: Optimizations are based on memory layout, not data types
System-Level: More concerned with alignment and memory patterns than type semantics
MyBitSort
Why not template?

Specific Domain: Designed specifically for bit manipulation on integer types
Fixed Algorithm: The bit-counting logic is tied to integer bit patterns
Could be templated: Actually, this could benefit from templating to support different integer types (uint32_t, uint16_t, etc.)
MyMalloc
Why not template?

Memory Management: Operates at raw memory level, type-agnostic
System Interface: Mimics C's malloc/free which are inherently untyped
Pool-Based: Manages chunks of raw bytes, not typed objects
Implementation Complexity: Adding type awareness would complicate the memory pool design
Alternative Design Considerations
If I were to redesign this, I might consider:

MyBitSort as template:

MyMalloc with typed allocator:

MyMemcpy could remain non-template since it's fundamentally about raw memory operations.

The current design prioritizes:

Simplicity for memory/byte-level operations
Genericity for algorithm/container operations
Performance by avoiding unnecessary abstractions
Usability by matching common patterns (STL-like for containers, C-like for memory ops)
